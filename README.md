This model of a deep neural network was created to simulated data of laminar combustion. For more academic background please consult the 
attached raport. 

## Requirements:

In order to be able to run the script, you need quite a lot of dependencies. Most of them are provided by
[Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). I strongly recommend you use it. Also ensure that you have Python3.6.<br />
Additionally, you need [Keras](https://keras.io/). Keras is neural network API for Python. To run, Keras needs either 
[Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano) or (recommended) [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow).
<br />
<br />
Additional thing, yet worth to have, is [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) and [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn).
It speeds the process of computation by using your GPU instead of CPU. Please note that you have to have an Nvidia GPU and BOTH
of the libraries.
